### Intro

python Group Project  for college, project.
Basically A Student Management System
Group Members are Dev Shah, Arth Patel, Dhruv Dave. They Don't really matter as I am a lone wolf after all. 

We can mange student stuffs like
- Admission
- Marks
- Attendance
- Information of Student: Edit Delete and Update
- Performance
etc.

## Flow

#### default page

I think default page should be Student Details.
Student Details must have Details of all students.
And Some filter properties
like search by roll num, name, enroll, Mentor, sem, branch, year, div

enroll | branch | sem | div | roll | name | mentor| phone num | email
-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-
